Generate MakeFile with: `cmake CMakeLists.txt` (make sure to remove CMakeCache.txt before, it keeps old paths that need to be refreshed when you try to compile the program in new directory, i.e. after you clone the repository or move it to new location) <br />
Compile code with: `make`  <br />
Run code with : `./out/Parallel`  <br />

Or use make file in `SourceFiles`
Compile code with: `make`  <br />
Run code with : `./Parallel`  <br />
